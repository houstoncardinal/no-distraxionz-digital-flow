## üî¥ CRITICAL: What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Get Your Stripe Publishable Key

1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_`)
3. Add it to your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE"
```

4. **Important:** Uncomment the line in `.env` and replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your actual key

### Step 2: Configure Deployment Environment Variables

Since `.env` is now gitignored (for security), you must add these environment variables to your hosting platform:

#### For Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Your Stripe secret key
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = Your Stripe publishable key
4. Redeploy your application

#### For Netlify:
1. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
2. Add the same variables as above
3. Trigger a new deploy

### Step 3: Enable Payment Methods in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods
2. Enable the payment methods you want to accept:
   - ‚úÖ Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
   - ‚úÖ Apple Pay
   - ‚úÖ Google Pay
   - Consider: Link, Afterpay, Klarna

### Step 4: Configure Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time updates about payments:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Enter your endpoint URL: `https://yourdomain.com/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. Select events to listen for:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `charge.refunded`
5. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Add to environment variables:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_YOUR_SECRET"
   ```

## üß™ Testing Your Integration

### Test Mode (Recommended First)

Before going live, test with Stripe test keys:

1. Get test keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Replace your keys with test versions:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."`
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."`

### Test Card Numbers

Use these test cards in test mode:

**Test Details:**
- Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
